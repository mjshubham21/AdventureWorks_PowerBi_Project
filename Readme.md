## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Tools Demonstrated

### üîπ Data Preparation & Cleaning (Power Query)
In Power BI Power Query:  
1. **Appended Sales Tables**  
   - Combined sales data from **2020, 2021, and 2022** into a single fact table called **SALES_FINAL**.  
2. **Product & Customer Tables**  
   - Cleaned data and added **conditional columns** such as:  
     - `isParent` (flag for parent products)  
     - `incomeLevel` (based on customer income brackets)  
     - `ageGroup` (derived from customer birthdate)  
   - Fixed incorrect **data types** across columns.  
3. **Calendar Table**  
   - Derived **Month Name, Day Name, and Quarter** from the Date column for time intelligence.  

---

### üîπ Data Modeling
- Built a **star schema** with **SALES_FINAL** as the central fact table, connected to dimension tables like Product Lookup, Customer Lookup, Territory, Calendar, and Categories.  
- Ensured proper **one-to-many (1:* ) relationships** between fact and dimension tables.  
- Created a **Measure Table** to store KPIs and calculated measures.

### üîπ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
Defined key business measures using DAX:  

```
DAX
Revenue = SUMX(
    SALES_FINAL,
    SALES_FINAL[OrderQuantity] * RELATED('Product Lookup'[ProductPrice])
)

TotalCost = SUMX(
    SALES_FINAL,
    SALES_FINAL[OrderQuantity] * RELATED('Product Lookup'[ProductCost])
)

ProfitMargin = [Revenue] - [TotalCost]
```
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts, KPIs, slicers, drill-throughs.  
- **Business Intelligence Reporting**: Revenue tracking, order distribution, trend analysis.  

---

**Functions Used in Measures**:

- **SUMX** ‚Üí For row-by-row calculations of Revenue and Cost.  
- **RELATED** ‚Üí To fetch product details like price and cost from dimension tables.  
- **COUNTROWS** ‚Üí To calculate total number of orders.  
- **DIVIDE** ‚Üí For safe division while avoiding divide-by-zero errors.  
- **IF** (used in conditional KPIs) ‚Üí For logic-based calculations (e.g., flagging performance trends).

### üîπ Row-Level Security (RLS)

To ensure **restricted access**, I implemented **Row-Level Security** in Power BI based on **regional managers**:

- Created **3 roles**:  
  - Europe Manager  
  - North America Manager  
  - Pacific Manager  

- Each role is restricted to view **only their own region‚Äôs data**.  

- Managers cannot access:  
  - Data/visuals from other regions.  
  - The underlying **data tables** or **model view** of unrelated regions.  
  - **Power BI Security** provides **fine-grained control** over **data access** and **dashboard permissions**.
